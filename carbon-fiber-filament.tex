\section{Carbon Fiber Filament}

In order to print the CFRP material, the carbon fiber and resin will be combined into a CFRP filament. As in conventional FDM printing, the CFRP filament will be extruded by driving it through a heated nozzle. ABS plastic was chosen as the matrix material for this filament for several reasons. First, ABS has already successfully been combined with chopped carbon fiber in FDM filaments. Second, ABS does not require post-processing to reach full strength, as epoxy-based pre-impregnated carbon fiber composites do.
